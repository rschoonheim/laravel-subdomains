# Laravel sub domains
Laravel has a convenient way to declare sub domains for your application. 
But it lacks a way to structure your code in a way that is easy to maintain.

This package is designed to integrate sub domains into your code in a maintainable way.




## Installation

```bash
composer require rschoonheim/laravel-subdomains
```
